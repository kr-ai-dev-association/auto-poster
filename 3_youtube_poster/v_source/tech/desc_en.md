The Keepers of the Flame: Protecting AI Sovereignty
"The story of those who master the temperature before the flames of intelligence consume humanity."

In 2026, South Korea’s "AI G3" ambitions hit a frozen wall of data. While global tech giants pushed the ceiling of universal intelligence—exemplified by Gemini 3 Pro’s staggering 92-point math score on the CSAT—domestic models faced a sobering reality, struggling to break past the 20s.

But is this the end? Far from it. 🛡️

We possess a "Cultural Moat" that global giants cannot cross. To protect our future, we must build a fortress rooted in the deep understanding of Korean law, history, and the intricate nuances of our language.

banya.ai does not aim to win a war of attrition against massive capital. Instead, we have chosen to be the "Ultimate Synthesizer," weaving together the legacies of the world's greatest models.

✨ The Four Spears of banya.ai:

🦅 Wielding Promethean Fire: We build upon the foundation of open-source intelligence liberated by Meta and Mistral.

⚡ Hyper-Efficiency: We implement the laws of computational efficiency pioneered by DeepSeek to achieve more with less.

🌊 The Cultural Moat: We are architecting "Vertical Sovereign AI" in specialized domains where global models lack context.

🛡️ Engineering Trust: Drawing lessons from the "Solar Pro 2" jailbreak incident, we prioritize flawless, reliable intelligence.

"The fire has been stolen. Now, it is time to master it." Join the epic journey of banya.ai and Neulpum AI as we defend Korea’s AI sovereignty with the sharpest spears in the industry. 🚀
