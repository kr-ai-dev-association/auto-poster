  "description": "The story of those who build cathedrals, not just stack bricks, in the age of intelligent machines.\n\nThe year is 2025. AI code generation promises a golden age, but a dark secret lurks beneath the surface: **Hidden Technical Debt**.\n\nAccording to GitClear's groundbreaking research, AI-generated code is **5-10%+ more likely to be deleted or rewritten shortly after creation**. We're drowning in spaghetti code 2.0, individually clean modules forming Frankenstein systems. 😱\n\nBut this is not the end. Far from it. 🛡️\n\nThe answer isn't *more* AI, but a **new role for the human developer**: the **Architect**. Shift from generating code to verifying and controlling it. Master the three pillars of control: Readability, Structuring, and Debugging.\n\n🔥 Your new mission: From Black Box to Exploded View. Disassemble the AI's creation. Understand its structure. Command, don't ask. Be the architect. Be the one with the blueprint.\n\nJoin the revolution. Reclaim control. 🚀\n\n📢 Service & Collaboration\n📱 Download Neulpum AI: Available on the [Google Play Store]\n\n✍️ Founder’s Tech Blog: [tony.banya.ai]\n\n🤝 Partnerships: [tony@banya.ai]\n\n🏢 Operator: Banya AI",
