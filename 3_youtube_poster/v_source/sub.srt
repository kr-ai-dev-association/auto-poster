1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,409
The year is 2026, the war for AI sovereignty is heating up.

2
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:12,259
We're on the front lines, laying out the battle plan.

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:19,469
Take on the global titans of AI, by hunting demons in code.

4
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:33,805
"You are a Specist, discriminating against silicon intelligence."

5
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:38,235
A civil war between the archmages of AI.

6
00:00:52,184 --> 00:01:00,124
Fast forward to today, what is the situation on the ground?

7
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:12,794
Our world is defined by a ceiling and a cultural moat.

8
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:25,223
Brutal results of the 2026 Korean CSAT Math Scores.

9
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:29,563
What about our models, our best ones?

10
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:39,733
Our models are scoring in the 20s, that's the ceiling.

11
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:44,673
Trying to fight these guys on their own terms is suicide.

12
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:54,728
If we can't touch that ceiling, how do we fight back?

13
00:01:54,728 --> 00:02:09,038
We don't attack the ceiling, we defend the moat. Our home turf!

14
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:22,162
The strategy: Play to our strengths and defend the home turf.

15
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:28,302
Where did this insane technology even come from?

16
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:32,402
Go back to the origin myth.

17
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:39,162
Geoffrey Hinton, pioneer of Deep Neural Networks.

18
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:51,685
Ilya Sutskever, who unleashed AlexNet upon the world.

19
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:24,055
Monopoly: Google wanted to control intelligence. Division: OpenAI to distribute.

20
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:41,415
A third faction: open source is all about giving away.

21
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:58,165
Yann LeCun: Intelligence must be shared.

22
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:53,652
What we call a jailbreak prompt, tricking AI to ignore safety rules.

23
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:15,461
Bigger is always better, or just a bigger target? A weakness.
